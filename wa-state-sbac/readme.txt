These files show the data analytics work behind my MS in Data Analytics capstone project. I analyzed the publicly available data from Washington State's High School standardized math tests and compared it with a variety of demographic, financial and achievement datasets available from the same school year. The main thesis centered around an independent investigation of the racial achievement gap and explored the data to try to find any underlying factors potentially contributing to the gap in the data.

prepare_data.ipynb documents the job of merging all available 2018-2019 school year data with the SBAC standardized test scores. 

data_exploration v2.ipynb performs the visualization, cluster analysis, and various other statistical analyses (multiple regression, five number summaries) used in my final report.

hypothesis_testing.ipynb shows the main statistical analysis of my capstone project, including chi^2 and Fisher's Exact Post Hoc tests.

Capstone Research Report.pdf is my report written for an academic audience detailing this investigation.
