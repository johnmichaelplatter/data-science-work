# data-science-work
This is collection my data wrangling, cleaning, analysis and visualization projects. 

Each folder above has a readme that explains the overview of the project and what each file contributes.

My goal is to create analyses that are transparent, reproducable and clear. This is why I am mainly showcasing jupyter notebook files, as this format allows me to perform reproducible analysis and describe what I am doing with a logical flow.

The following skills are showcased in this portfolio:

While these projects work mainly in Python, I am also recognized as a SAS Certified Statistical Business Analyst Using SAS 9: Regression and Modeling (see ...certificate.pdf). 
Furthermore, I have experience in R too, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to see code samples in R.
