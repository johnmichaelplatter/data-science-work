These notebooks and files comprise my final project during my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I investigated the massive set of 2012 PISA scores around the world and looked for correlations with any of the other info known about these test takers, including things like wealth level, how many minutes per week they spend in their math classroom, how often they skip school days, etc... A large portion of the analysis focuses specifically on understanding the gap between math scores of children in the USA vs. those in Finland. 

pisa_data_exploration.ipynb examines the pisa2012.csv dataset. It trims down the desired dataset to include only the variables I explored, performs univariate, bivariate and multivariate explorations, and features some visualizations I am very proud of to this day. 

PISA_data_slide_deck.ipynb was used to generate a polished presentation that presents my findings AND makes the source code transparent and easy to reproduce.

PISA_data_slide_deck.slides.html is the set of slides discussed above.

PISAdict2012.csv is the set of descriptors for the columns of pisa2012.csv


I can supply the pisa2012.csv used in the above code by request, as it is a very large file (2.75GB)! I unfortunately am not able to host it on github due to its large size.
