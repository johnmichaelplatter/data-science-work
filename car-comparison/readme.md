This project demonstrates my comfort with web scraping and ability to create meaningful and easy-to-read data visualizations. I utilize a few important python modules including `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, `seaborne`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` in an attempt to answer one main question - what car should my company buy?

I begin by programmatically accessing Kelley Blue Book and Cars.com with the `requests` module and parse the desired inforfmation with the `beautifulsoup` module. The data is stored in **`scraped.xls`**, then cleaned and stored in **`cleaned.xls`**. Finally, my visualizations, created with `matplotlib` and `seaborne`, are showcased in **`Data Visualizations.pdf`**.

#### Files Described

**`ADE2.ipynb`** shows all python code used to access, scrape, clean and visualize the car data.

**`scraped.xls`** and **`cleaned.xls`** contain the data compiled from my web scraper and used for the analysis and visualization (accessed 8/27/2020).

**`Data Visualizations.pdf`** compiles the set of figures created to help justify my choice of car.
