This project demonstrates my comfort with web scraping and creating meaningful data visualizations. I utilize a few important python modules including requests, beatifulsoup, seaborne, matplotlib, and pandas in an attempt to answer one main question - what car should my company buy?
Kelley Blue Book and Cars.com are programmatically accessed and the data is stored in scraped.xls, then cleaned and stored in cleaned.xls. Finally, my visualizations, created with matplotlib and seaborne, are showcased in Data Visualizations.pdf.

ADE2.ipynb shows all python code used to access, scrape, clean and visualize the car data.

scraped.xls and cleaned.xls contain the data used for the analysis and visualization (accessed 8/27/2020).

Data Visualizations.pdf compiles the set of figures created to help justify my choice of car.
