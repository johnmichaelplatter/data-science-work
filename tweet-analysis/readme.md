#### @dog_rates Tweet Analysis

This was a project for Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree. These tweets from @dog_rates were accessed via the `tweepy` python twitter API, then cleaned and analyzed. 

#### Files Described

**`wrangle_act.ipynb`** is a jupyter notebook of my full analysis that 1) accessed the tweets using `tweepy` 2) merged all available data and 3) performed some statistical analysis and visualization of the @dog_rates tweets over time.

**`ai_predicts.tsv`** was generated by Udacity and handed to me. It predicts the dog breed, and this data was included in my analysis.

**`twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`** was additional data Udacity handed to me that aided in the analysis of the tweets.
