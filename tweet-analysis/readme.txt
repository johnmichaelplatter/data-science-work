This was a project for Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree. These tweets from @dog_rates were accessed via the tweepy twitter API, cleaned and analyzed. 

The ai_predicts.tsv file was generated by Udacity and handed to me in order to predict the dog breed, and this data was included in my analysis.
The twitter_archive_enhanced.csv was additional data handed to me that aided in the analysis of the tweets.
wrangle_act.ipynb is a jupyter notebook of my full analysis that 1) accessed the tweets using tweepy 2) merged all available and 3) performed some statistical analysis and visualization of the dog ratings over time and the language of the tweets.
